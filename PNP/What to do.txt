As Editor I choosed portable Programmer's Notepad:
https://github.com/simonsteele/pn/releases/download/v2.4.2/portable-pn2421440.zip
I made some additions in UserTools.xml

1. Download https://github.com/simonsteele/pn/releases/download/v2.4.2/portable-pn2421440.zip
2. Unpack portable-pn2421440.zip
3. Copy (only the contents) from "portable-pn2421440" to ..\IDE\PNP
4. Locate ..\MyIDE\PNP\settings
5. Delete the file "UserTools.xml" 
5. Rename the file "UserTools.xml.new" to "UserTools.xml"

In consequence of this you get the following structure:

MyIDE
  |
  + -- PNP
        |
	+ -- clips
        |
	+ -- ctags   
        |
	+ -- schemas
        |
	+ -- settings
		|
		+ -- UserTools.xml
