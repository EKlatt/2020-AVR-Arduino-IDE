This IDE runs within the Windows-Shell.
The IDE-folder ..\MyIDE\avra contains assembler "avra.exe" compiled from:
https://github.com/Ro5bert/avra/archive/1.4.2.zip
The new version of avra-assembler needs to be compiled first.
See description in: 
https://rclelectronics.blogspot.com/2014/12/avra-assembler-under-windows.html
So the AVR assembler can be called within the IDE.

1. Download: https://github.com/Ro5bert/avra/archive/1.4.2.zip
2. Compile it with e.g. "Dev-C++"
3. Copy avra.exe to "your path"\MyIDE\avra\avra.exe
