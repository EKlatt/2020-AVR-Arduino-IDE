# Assembler-Manual<br>
You may write code in Assembler. 

### Assembler families

- Assembler standalone (GNU AVR-GCC) 
- Assembler standalone (AVR compatible Assembler avra) 
- Inline Assembler
- Mixing Assembler & C++ or C code

##### Assembler standalone (GNU AVR-GCC)

The way  of compiling and assembling with GNU AVR-GC:

<img src="Building a Code - Workflow.jpg" alt="img" style="zoom:80%;" />

In this case we write the code in **GNU AVR-GCC assembler**. <br>
We invoke the compiling and assembling process with the **avr-gcc C-compiler**.<br>
After precompiling, the assembler "avr-as.exe" is invoked automatically.<br>
The source file needs to have the extension "**myFile.S**".<br>
Therefore "**makefile**" expects the file extension capital '**S'**.<br>

##### Assembler standalone (AVR Assembler AVRA)
If you check out the assemblers for 8 bit micro processors  you will <br>notice a assembler with the name "AVRA".<br>
I decided to integrate this assembler in MyIDE. <br>
The source file needs to have the extension **"myFile.asm"**.<br>
Therefore "**makefile**" expects the file extension **"asm"**.

##### Differences GNU AVR-GCC to AVR Assembler AVRA<br>
Unfortunately, the syntax differs slightly between these two assemblers. And it turns out that the syntax differences are big <br>enough to make the conversion of existing source code a non-trivial task that tends to take way longer than expected.<br>

##### Inline Assembler
With the GNU avr-gcc compiler for AVR micro processors you may embed assembly language code into C++ or C programs.<br>
 This feature may be used for manually optimizing time critical parts of the software or to use specific processor instruction, <br>which are not available in the C++ or C language.<br>

Therefore "makefile" expects the file extension "cpp" or 'c'.<br>
I didn't check this way of coding with MyIDE.<br>

##### Mixing Assembler & C++ or C code

You may write code in C++ or C code and using functions which are written in Assembler.<br>
